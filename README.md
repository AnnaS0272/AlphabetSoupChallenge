>>>How many neurons and layers did you select for your neural network model? Why?

I selected 2 layers, for the first layer 3 * number of attributes, --> 44 * 3 = 130, for the second layer I narrowed down to approx. half of the first payer by experimenting.

>>>Were you able to achieve the target model performance? What steps did you take to try and increase model performance?

I was able to achieve the target performance just about but I could not achieve higher results without further grouping and categorizing data, for example on on INC_AMOUNT and ASK_AMOUNT data columns I wasn't sure if such groupings or categorizations would ultimately distort the original data, so I chose not to procees.

>>>If you were to implement a different model to solve this classification problem, which would you choose? Why? I would probably try RandomForest, because unlike Deep Learning, it's high on both accurancy and interpretability while Deep Learning is only high on accuracy.
